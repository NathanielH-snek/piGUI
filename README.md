# A Graphical Interface for Picamera2

## Usage
Currently there is not a formal release for this yet. If you would like to use this GUI I would suggest creating a conda environment, and then cloning this repository to use at your leisure. There is an included environment.yaml file for you to use. A full release may come in the future.
